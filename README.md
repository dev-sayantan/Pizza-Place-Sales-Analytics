Project - Pizza Place Sales Analytics

Welcome to my first Microsoft Excel-based data analysis project. I tried to examine and investigate the dataset available on the Kaggle Platform to generate some business insights.

Here is the dataset link on kaggle - The Pizza Place Sales Dataset => https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/pizza-place-sales

The project had undergone multiple stages of analysis from dataset cleaning, formatting, and data preparation before the real analysis took place.

To conduct my analysis, I mainly used Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software of the Microsoft 365 family. I applied advanced concepts and techniques of data analysis with Excel such as pivot tables, lookup functions, statistical functions, math functions, and text functions. With those functions, I created the required formulas to extract, fetch data, and understand the hidden flow and patterns within the data as well. Also, many types of charts are applied to visually understand the data pattern and relationships between the variables.

This report is informative. It will surely help the management to take critical business decisions and accomplish their business goals and objectives.

I appreciate your valuable time and attention to take a deep dive into my analysis.

Thank you.
